# Game Day Forecast
## Description
The Game Day Forecast is designed to allow a user to look up a team playing sometime in the next 30 days and get brief details of the games (i.e. location, opponent, and date) in a list format. Upon clicking on one of these list elements, the user will see accurate, up-to-date weather in the location of the game on the day it takes place. The app is designed to run in the browser and update automatically on element submission.
